### About me

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! As a software engineering graduate from Makers Academy, I am a versatile and well-rounded developer with a strong focus on both front-end and back-end development. My skills are particularly strong in Javascript and Ruby, and I have completed numerous projects from scratch, as well as improved upon pre-existing code.

What sets me apart from other developers is my background in recruitment and technology, which has given me exceptional interpersonal skills and a deep understanding of the tech industry. I am passionate about staying on the cutting edge of emerging technologies and currently working on several ongoing projects to enhance my coding abilities.

I am seeking a challenging role in a dynamic and innovative organization where I can make meaningful contributions to the tech industry while continuing to grow as a software engineer. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, feel free to explore my GitHub repositories of pop me a message. Thank you for stopping by!
